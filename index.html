        <h2>Epicodus</h2>
          <p>I decided to join <strong>Epicodus</strong> for many reasons. I always wanted to learn how to code but didn't know where to begin. I had a couple friends who took classes at Epicodus and they recommended it to me. So far, I love it. I've always wanted to <span>make my own apps</span>. It's a new skill that I'm learning as well so taking this class did not have any cons. Most importantly, I wanted a change of <strong>career</strong> and hope to soon become a programmer.</p>
